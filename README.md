# MatrixLink
 MatrixLink is an IoT project where at least two ESP8266 devices, each with an LED matrix and a 1.9 inch tft screen, allow users to exchange pixel drawings and messages globally in real-time. A web interface lets users create and send content to the other device instantly, enabling a creative and interactive communication experience across any distance.


This is a fun project where I will be learning about ESP8266, tft-displays, neopixel LED's, server communication, 3D modelling and hopefully many more stuff!
The project is open for anyone to contribute.


## Functionality
The device itself will be an ESP8266 connected to an 8x8 LED matrix for the drawing, a tft screen fot the written message and sender, a button for refreshing manually, a potentiometer for turing up or down the brightness and a swithc for turning the device off.

I am working on the code in the Arduino IDE and the repo is a manual/ guide to the project.
The code should be available in this repository soon.
All the components are self-paid and this project is purely for educational purposes.

# List of materials
All the used materials and hardware will be listed below. Most of the components are from AliExpress due to me being a student and not having a lot of bucks :).
The order links are also shared below. With the components below you should be able to recreate a MatrixLink device without problems.

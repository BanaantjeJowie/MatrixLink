# MatrixLink
 MatrixLink is an IoT project where two ESP8266 devices, each with an LED matrix, allow users to exchange pixel drawings and messages globally in real-time. A web interface lets users create and send content to the other device instantly, enabling a creative and interactive communication experience across any distance.
